A_e = ae = convective coefficient = Equation 15. ap, ae, an, aw, as

epsilon = tolerance for convergence

in solve_momentum, source term multiplier is switched from dy to dx, dx to dy.
Matches my explanation in Equations 17 and 18.
If non convergence, switch this and try again. If it then converges, then find why.

combine v = solve() and u = solve() into solve_uv_momentum()
